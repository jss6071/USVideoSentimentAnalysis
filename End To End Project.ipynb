(好きになっちゃうだろう？)’, 마지막화에서 공개된 단체곡 ‘꿈을 꾸는 동안’ , ‘PRODUCE48’의 메인 테마곡 ‘내꺼야’의 ‘IZ*ONE(아이즈원)’ 버전 등이 새롭게 수록 돼 ‘PRODUCE48’부터 아이즈원을 지켜본 이들이라면 새로운 매력을 느낄 수 있다. 데뷔 미니 앨범 ＜COLOR*IZ＞를  시작으로 아이즈원 멤버들이 전 세계를 향해 보여줄 12가지 색깔의 매력을 지켜 보자.</td></tr><tr><td>D2O7LPnaU7I</td><td>TIME TO SHOOT THE TEAM 10 MOVIE!</td><td>2018-10-28 19:44:44.000</td><td>UCcgVECVN4OKV6DH1jLkqmcA</td><td>Jake Paul</td><td>22</td><td>18.01.11</td><td>jake|paul|logan|its|everyday|bro|team10|jerika|vlogs|jakepaulers|champion|erika|costell bizaardvark|edfluence|fanjoy|brothers|merch|link|in|bio|logang|family|friendly sherlock|love|you|can|it|bra|lamborghini|actor|daily|adventures|crazy|fortnite|killer|clown|justin|roberts|work|progress|episode|pnline|stream|reunion|back|old|members|tessa|brooks|nick|crompton</td><td>2472525</td><td>75346</td><td>25562</td><td>12833</td><td>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D2O7LPnaU7I/default.jpg</td><td>SUBSCRIBE TO JUSTIN'S CHANNEL!!https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdD2...👕GET MY NEW MERCH HERE BEFORE IT SELLS OUT 👕https://fanjoy.co/collections/jake-paul 🔵SPONSOR MY CHANNEL FOR EXCLUSIVE CONTENT & MORE 🔵https://www.youtube.com/user/JakePaulProductions/sponsorADD ME ON TWITCH ►https://www.twitch.tv/jakepaulgames🔔TURN ON MY POST NOTIFICATIONS FOR SHOUTOUTS IN MY VLOG➡️FOLLOW ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA! ⬅️INSTAGRAM ➤  https://www.instagram.com/JakePaul TWITTER ➤  http://twitter.com/JakePaul FACEBOOK ➤  https://www.facebook.com/JakePaul SNAPCHAT ➤  JakePaul19 MUSICAL.LY ➤  @JakePaul➡️FOLLOW TEAM 10! ⬅️Twitter ➝ http://twitter.com/Team10official Instagram ➝ http://instagram.com/Team10official Facebook ➝ http://instagram.com/Team10official Snapchat ➝ Team10SnapsMusical.ly ➝ @Team10officialWant to text us?  ➝ 1-323-909-4406📗I HAVE A BOOK!! “YOU GOTTA WANT IT 📗 http://amzn.to/2hY5Pyx⚠️ WARNING ⚠️Some effects and visuals may not be suitable for those that suffer from epilepsy.#JakePaul #Team10 #ItsEverydayBro</td></tr><tr><td>8BAmUw45ZkI</td><td>THE TRUTH ABOUT BOYS IN THE BEAUTY COMMUNITY</td><td>2018-10-28 20:00:47.000</td><td>UCkvK_5omS-42Ovgah8KRKtg</td><td>jeffreestar</td><td>26</td><td>18.01.11</td><td>jeffree star|jeffree star cosmetics|blood sugar palette|alien palette|jeffree star approved|jeffree star makeup tutorial|louis vuitton bag|cole carrigann|Anastasia Beverly Hills|cutting louis vuitton bag|jeffree star transformation|james charles|jaclyn hill|tati westbrook|boys in beauty|boys in beauty community|the truth about beauty community|patrick starrr|mmmitchell|special fx makeup|louis vuitton costume|velour liquid lipstick</td><td>2991529</td><td>156031</td><td>6658</td><td>20243</td><td>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8BAmUw45ZkI/default.jpg</td><td>HEY EVERYONE...

He’s not blind, nor stupid – nothing like that. He’s dyslexic. This generally means that he’s physically not able to read or write. Or more precisely, he can do it, but he does it 100 times slower than other people. But don’t feel sorry for him! He’s happy this way. Here’s the story of what happened to him.His parents always told him that he needed to do the best he could in his studies in order to excel in life. They’re both very successful – his dad is a lawyer and his mom is a physicist, so his future was well defined from birth. He was supposed to become nothing less than a brain surgeon. And indeed he remembers how he could already do a lot even in his early years – maths, science for kids, things like that. The only thing that worried his parents was that he didn’t manage to learn to read. But he was still very small, so they thought that since he was attending school anyway he would get taught there.When school started, Billy realized straightaway that he was slower than the other kids. It was strange – he had never seemed stupid before; he was generally quick-witted and easily understood anything that was explained to him. But when it came to reading or working with a text of any kind, he seemed to be really slow. For Billy, letters looked like splashes of water that were constantly changing their shape and size. His teachers kept telling him to concentrate, but what was he supposed to do if words were like insects flying off the paper?Billy remembers the first ever test that he got marks for. He understood it was very important to bring a good mark home to his parents, to show them that he wasn’t stupid. He did his best, but unfortunately managed to answer only 3 questions out of 12 in time. He didn’t understand what had happened – the questions were not hard and he knew the answers, but it just took a lot of time to understand what was written and compose his written answer. He broke into a sweat. The last thing he managed to do was write his name, Bill Bumble, on it. As the teacher looked them over she asked him to stand up and read his name from the paper. “Bill Bumble”, he said. She then insisted that he read it from the paper. With great effort, he read what he had actually written. It was “Bill Dumble”. Everyone laughed at him and he felt so embarrassed. “Dumble” became his nickname from that moment on.This made Billy sad, and he ended up being mocked all day and getting a D-. He decided not to suffer on his own, and went to see his parents. They frowned when he told them that he had nearly gotten an F, but when he explained his vanishing letter problem, they decided to take him to see an optician. She checked his eyes and confirmed that his vision was perfect, but suggested a visit to another doctor who specialized in learning problems. He was a very nice man who listened to Billy attentively, and then asked him to show him how he wrote. Then Billy said that he could draw what he saw instead. He liked to draw a lot, and it seemed like it was the only thing that he was really good at. He drew things exactly how he saw them.The doctor told Billy’s parents that their son had a talent, and they seemed very impressed seeing it themselves. He then said that Billy had dyslexia, a chronic condition that can be improved but never cured, and that he needed to find a way to somehow adapt to his studies. He gave recommendations to extent how long he was able to take on a test and to use more audio materials, but after some time at school Billy understood that he still lagged behind, and everyone was still mocking him because of it. He found it hard to concentrate on his subjects, and his marks slipped even more. So his parents enrolled him in another school that specialized in individualized creative teaching.That’s how he found out that he’s actually pretty smart! He had a tutor who adapted all his subjects to his visual comprehension. He received creative tasks that involved drawing some process or rule instead of describing it in written form, and he was given audiobooks instead of textbooks. And he also took art classes where he became the best straightaway!Billy is still a long way off from finishing school – he’s now in his early teens. But he already knows what he wants to be without a doubt – he wants to be an artist, because it’s the thing that he enjoys most in his life. Thanks to his dyslexia, Billy now never has to study all those things he’s no good at, and doesn’t have to struggle to find out what he really likes, which is drawing. Now he can say that he’s happy to let those letters fly away - he’s better off without them.Music by Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com</td></tr><tr><td>SAWzXkV3hHo</td><td>Shawn Mendes, Zedd - Lost In Japan (Original + Remix)</td><td>2018-10-26 02:40:35.000</td><td>UC4-TgOSMJHn-LtY4zCzbQhw</td><td>ShawnMendesVEVO</td><td>10</td><td>18.01.11</td><td>Shawn|Mendes|Zedd|Lost|In|Japan|(Original|Remix)|Island|Records|Pop|shawn mendes lost in japan|lost in japan shawn mendes|shawn mendes zedd lost in japan remix|lost in japan remix shawn mendes zedd|zedd lost in japan remix|lost in japan remix zedd|lost in japan official music video|lost in japan remix official music video|lost in japan music video|let’s get lost tonight|i can’t get you off my mind</td><td>12152765</td><td>963058</td><td>12109</td><td>60391</td><td>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SAWzXkV3hHo/default.jpg</td><td>Lost In Japan: https://IslandRecs.lnk.to/LostInJapan Lost In Japan (Remix): https://islandrecs.lnk.to/LostInJapanRemixStream/buy Shawn Mendes: The Album now: https://IslandRecs.lnk.to/ShawnMendesFollow Shawn Mendes:Twitter: https://twitter.com/shawnmendesInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/shawnmendesFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ShawnMendesOfficialWebsite: https://www.shawnmendesofficial.comFollow Zedd:Subscribe to YouTube channel: http://zedd.me/YTSubscribeWebsite: https://www.zedd.netFacebook: http://zedd.me/FacebookInstagram: http://zedd.me/InstagramSpotify: http://zedd.me/SPEssentialsTwitter: http://zedd.me/TwitterVK: http://zedd.me/VKcomSnapchat: http://zedd.me/SnapchatShop the Zedd Official Store: http://zedd.me/StoreListen to Zedd Radio: http://zedd.me/SPRadioSee Zedd live: http://zedd.me/LiveLyrics:All it'd take is one flightWe be in the same time zoneLooking through your timelineSeeing all the rainbows, II got an ideaAnd I know that it sounds crazyI just wanna see yaAll I gotta ask,Do you got plans tonight?I’m a couple hundred miles from Japan and IAnd I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight‘Cause I can’t get you off my mindCan’t get you off my mindCan’t get you off my mind (uhh)I can feel the tensionWe could cut it with a knifeI know it’s more than just a friendshipI can hear you think I’m right, yeahDo I gotta convince you that you shouldn’t fall asleep?It’ll only be a couple hours,And I’m about to leaveDo you got plans tonight?I’m a couple hundred miles from Japan and IAnd I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight‘Cause I can’t get you off my mindCan’t get you off my mindCan’t get you off my mindDo you got plans tonight?I was hoping I could get lost in your paradiseThe only thing I’m thinking ‘bout is you and i‘Cause I can’t get you off my mindCan’t get you off my mindI can’t seem to get you off my mindLet’s get lost tonight (uhh)Let’s get lost tonightBaby you and…I can’t seem to get you off my mindLet’s get lost tonightLet’s get lost tonightBaby you and…I can’t seem to get you off my mindDo you got plans tonight?I’m a couple hundred miles from Japan and IAnd I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight‘Cause I can’t get you off my mindI can’t get you off my mindDo you got plans tonight, babyI was hoping I could get lost in your paradiseThe only thing I’m thinking ‘bout is you and IAnd I can’t get you off my mindCan’t get you off my mindI can’t seem to get you off my mindLet’s get lost tonightLet’s get lost tonightBaby you and…I can’t seem to get you off my mindLet’s get lost tonightLet’s get lost tonightBaby you and…I can’t seem to get you off my mindMusic video by Shawn Mendes, Zedd performing Lost In Japan (Original + Remix). © 2018 Island Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.http://vevo.ly/txtHgL</td></tr><tr><td>6F1iqcxvfBc</td><td>NBA Youngboy - Temporary Time</td><td>2018-10-26 00:45:20.000</td><td>UClW4jraMKz6Qj69lJf-tODA</td><td>YoungBoy Never Broke Again</td><td>1</td><td>18.01.11</td><td>[none]</td><td>3340201</td><td>128494</td><td>3020</td><td>10643</td><td>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6F1iqcxvfBc/default.jpg</td><td>NEW YB@Tobiali</td></tr><tr><td>MYNl2Y5AV3g</td><td>Mermaid Halloween Makeup Tutorial</td><td>2018-10-26 20:10:12.000</td><td>UCucot-Zp428OwkyRm2I7v2Q</td><td>James Charles</td><td>24</td><td>18.01.11</td><td>james|james charles|makeup artist|mua|covergirl|coverboy|cute|jeffree star|manny mua|easy makeup|how-to|reviews|tutorials|funny videos|beauty tips|hacks|beauty|mermaid|halloween|makeup tutorial|james charles halloween|halloween makeup|special fx|fx</td><td>3499561</td><td>187090</td><td>3386</td><td>14492</td><td>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MYNl2Y5AV3g/default.jpg</td><td>HI SISTERS!

What began as an unlikely friendship between an adolescent Viking and a fearsome Night Fury dragon has become an epic adventure spanning their lives.  Welcome to the most astonishing chapter of one of the most beloved animated franchises in film history: How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World.  Now chief and ruler of Berk alongside Astrid, Hiccup has created a gloriously chaotic dragon utopia.  When the sudden appearance of female Light Fury coincides with the darkest threat their village has ever faced, Hiccup and Toothless must leave the only home they’ve known and journey to a hidden world thought only to exist in myth.  As their true destines are revealed, dragon and rider will fight together—to the very ends of the Earth—to protect everything they’ve grown to treasure.For How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, series director Dean DeBlois returns alongside the all-star cast.  The film is produced by Brad Lewis (Ratatouille, ANTZ) and Bonnie Arnold (Toy Story, How to Train Your Dragon,How to Train Your Dragon 2).Follow DreamWorksTV! instagram - https://instagram.com/dreamworkstv/twitter - https://twitter.com/dreamworkstvfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/dreamworkstvJoin the fun on DreamWorksTV where you can find an endless supply of laugh-out-loud jokes, lovable characters, life hacks, music, magic, gaming and more!

Freddie defied stereotypes and shattered convention to become one of the most beloved entertainers on the planet. The film traces the meteoric rise of the band through their iconic songs and revolutionary sound. They reach unparalleled success, but in an unexpected turn Freddie, surrounded by darker influences, shuns Queen in pursuit of his solo career. Having suffered greatly without the collaboration of Queen, Freddie manages to reunite with his bandmates just in time for Live Aid. While bravely facing a recent AIDS diagnosis, Freddie leads the band in one of the greatest performances in the history of rock music. Queen cements a legacy that continues to inspire outsiders, dreamers and music lovers to this day.In Theaters November 2, 2018Cast: Rami Malek, Lucy Boynton, Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, Joseph Mazzello, Aidan Gillen, Tom Hollander, Allen Leech and Mike MyersDirected by: Bryan SingerConnect with Bohemian Rhapsody Online:Visit the Bohemian Rhapsody WEBSITE: http://bohemianrhapsody.comLike Bohemian Rhapsody on FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/BohemianRhapsodyMovieFollow Bohemian Rhapsody on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/BoRhapMovieFollow Bohemian Rhapsody on INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/BohemianRhapsodyMovie#BohemianRhapsodyAbout 20th Century FOX:Official YouTube Channel for 20th Century Fox Movies.

I really have come to appreciate the writing/humor of the show. I think it is so important to be able to not only create a show that is interesting but also keeping it medically accurate and give a great example of how one with autism can strive to new heights. If we can get this video up to 100,000 likes I can use that to try and get Freddie Highmore to do a review with us so smash that like button!!!Anyway, I hope you enjoy this episode of Real Doctor Watches The Good Doctor  / Real Doctor Reacts to The Good Doctor .

I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!WATCH THE WHOLE SERIES: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...So, this is a special episode because instead of doing my regular 3-4 makeovers, I am doing ONE. BUT the reason is because after my last unboxing video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N03vtRodaQg&t=31s) everyone was begging me to do the giant orange. I knew I wouldn't have time to fit it into a regular video since it's so massive. So I just decided to go all out and take all week working on this one squishy. There is more squishy roasting than any video before. SO MANY REPAIRS. 10 squishies. 8 bottles of paint. Lots of record breaking here LOL I hope you enjoy it!________ Materials List__________http://www.moriah.video/materials.html_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already 2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. Everyone gave me these squishies as donations to the series because they were no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be completely impossible for me financially to send back squishies. Just to RECEIVE these squishies costs me hundreds of dollars (I have to pay for P.O. box fees) There are MANY other reasons as well, I explained it in this video if you want to know the full list of reasons: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKYCV...3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip and Scribbles. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.4. IS PUFFY PAINT THE SAME AS FABRIC PAINT?Yep!! Puffy paint is just a type of fabric paint.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off. 7. WHAT MEMORY FOAM DO YOU USE?I usually just buy a memory foam pillow on Amazon.com and use that to cut up.8. CAN YOU DO MORE SQUISHIES IN EACH VIDEO OR DO MAKEOVER VIDEOS EVERY WEEK?I wish I could! But these videos take me about 30-50 hours to film and edit (not including waiting for the paint to dry or any breaks). And usually about 8 or 9 days of working on it. So it’s not really possible to do these any more than I am already doing without lowering the quality. PLUS! I want to keep up with my Monday videos and my art and craft videos as well ☺9. WHY DO YOU SOMETIMES USE A POPSICLE STICK AND OTHER TIMES USE A PAINTBRUSH TO APPLY PAINT?The “slick” fabric paint has a very thick consistency that does not spread easily with a paint brush. Using a popsicle stick is much easier for this type of paint. BUT the matte fabric paint is much thinner, similar consistency to acrylic paint and it can easily be applied with a paintbrush. When you mix the two, you can get away with a paintbrush as well :)10. WHY DO YOU LIKE RAINBOW SO MUCH?I just like color, and I think rainbows are pretty. There’s really no other reason for my obsession hahaMY CURRENT UPLOAD SCHEDULE:Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Squishy Makeovers (roughly every other Friday), Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kits and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYsANDEvery Other Monday:  Squishy Updates, Create This Book episodes, mail openings/unboxings, announcements, experiments or any other weirdness I come up with...WHERE TO BUY MY BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfIVISIT MY WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/MY MERCH:https://teespring.com/stores/moriah-e...INSTAGRAM: instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficialFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES OR Create This Book photos ONLY:MoriahElizabeth15@gmail.com</td></tr><tr><td>p1mJP5TVCjE</td><td>The Try Guys Answer the Web's Most Searched Questions | WIRED</td><td>2018-10-19 16:21:52.000</td><td>UCftwRNsjfRo08xYE31tkiyw</td><td>WIRED</td><td>24</td><td>18.01.11</td><td>autocomplete interview|google autocomplete|the try guys|try guys|wired autocomplete interview|try guys autocomplete|the try guys autocomplete|try guys autocomplete interview|ned try guys|keith try guys|zach try guys|eugene try guys|try guys funny|the try guys autocomplete interview|the try guys wired|try guys google|try guys streamys|try guys buzzfeed|try guys funny moments|try guys wired|the try guys interview|wired</td><td>3695293</td><td>160197</td><td>2823</td><td>6821</td><td>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p1mJP5TVCjE/default.jpg</td><td>Keith, Ned, Zach, and Eugene of The Try Guys take the WIRED Autocomplete Interview and answer the internet's most searched questions about The Try Guys and themselves.

These purchases, especially impulse buys, present an opportunity for retailers who can entice consumers to deviate from their shopping lists.One of the most effective ways to influence this is through a store’s architecture. In the 20th century, the architect Victor Gruen, who pioneered the first American shopping malls, used light and space to dramatically stage goods in storefront windows. His designs were meant to capture the attention of passersby — and convert them into customers. This conversion became known as the “Gruen effect.”Watch the video above to learn how Ikea has mastered the Gruen effect with a carefully designed store layout that gets customers to travel further distances… and buy more.For the curious, here are a few links:Read Jeffrey Inman’s research on unplanned spending: http://www.advancingretail.org/sites/default/files/resources/The-Effect-of-In-Store-Travel-Distance-on-Unplanned-Spending.pdfWatch a video from University College London Professor Alan Penn, who breaks down Ms. Kazim’s research in greater detail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkePRXxH9D4And finally, I recommend reading Victor Gruen’s biography, “Mallmaker” by Jeffrey Hardwick. You can also learn more by listening to this 99% Invisible podcast episode that features Hardwick and details the history of the Gruen effect: https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-gruen-effect/Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Thankfully, using Wix, it's easy, accessible, and affordable too! Get your own URL, customize your layout, add key features like portfolios or shopping options (there are over 200 features to choose from!), and — of course — get creative! Follow the link to Wix at the top of the description to get started, or if you feel like you want some help, tweet me @mrkatedotcom your profile with the hashtag #CreativeWeirdoSpotlight and for the next What's My Aesthetic video, we might be building your page! During some episodes of this series, Joey and I will be creating a custom website for one of you Creative Weirdos using Wix, and showing it off to the world! This episode, we featured an amazing cupcake baker, and I can't wait to see how her colorful, interactive new website helps her business grow! If you have a business or brand that you want to share with the world, don't stop at just social media pages! Make it official with a Wix website — because there's nothing more in the DIY spirit than creating a professional website yourself! MORE MAKEOVERS!

(好きになっちゃうだろう？)’, 마지막화에서 공개된 단체곡 ‘꿈을 꾸는 동안’ , ‘PRODUCE48’의 메인 테마곡 ‘내꺼야’의 ‘IZ*ONE(아이즈원)’ 버전 등이 새롭게 수록 돼 ‘PRODUCE48’부터 아이즈원을 지켜본 이들이라면 새로운 매력을 느낄 수 있다. 데뷔 미니 앨범 ＜COLOR*IZ＞를  시작으로 아이즈원 멤버들이 전 세계를 향해 보여줄 12가지 색깔의 매력을 지켜 보자."

         "SUBSCRIBE If you like my channel: ► https://bit.ly/2J5HP7jThis is Billy, and he can’t read. He’s not blind, nor stupid – nothing like that. He’s dyslexic. This generally means that he’s physically not able to read or write. Or more precisely, he can do it, but he does it 100 times slower than other people. But don’t feel sorry for him! He’s happy this way. Here’s the story of what happened to him.His parents always told him that he needed to do the best he could in his studies in order to excel in life. They’re both very successful – his dad is a lawyer and his mom is a physicist, so his future was well defined from birth. He was supposed to become nothing less than a brain surgeon. And indeed he remembers how he could already do a lot even in his early years – maths, science for kids, things like that. The only thing that worried his parents was that he didn’t manage to learn to read. But he was still very small, so they thought that since he was attending school anyway he would get taught there.When school started, Billy realized straightaway that he was slower than the other kids. It was strange – he had never seemed stupid before; he was generally quick-witted and easily understood anything that was explained to him. But when it came to reading or working with a text of any kind, he seemed to be really slow. For Billy, letters looked like splashes of water that were constantly changing their shape and size. His teachers kept telling him to concentrate, but what was he supposed to do if words were like insects flying off the paper?Billy remembers the first ever test that he got marks for. He understood it was very important to bring a good mark home to his parents, to show them that he wasn’t stupid. He did his best, but unfortunately managed to answer only 3 questions out of 12 in time. He didn’t understand what had happened – the questions were not hard and he knew the answers, but it just took a lot of time to understand what was written and compose his written answer. He broke into a sweat. The last thing he managed to do was write his name, Bill Bumble, on it. As the teacher looked them over she asked him to stand up and read his name from the paper. “Bill Bumble”, he said. She then insisted that he read it from the paper. With great effort, he read what he had actually written. It was “Bill Dumble”. Everyone laughed at him and he felt so embarrassed. “Dumble” became his nickname from that moment on.This made Billy sad, and he ended up being mocked all day and getting a D-. He decided not to suffer on his own, and went to see his parents. They frowned when he told them that he had nearly gotten an F, but when he explained his vanishing letter problem, they decided to take him to see an optician. She checked his eyes and confirmed that his vision was perfect, but suggested a visit to another doctor who specialized in learning problems. He was a very nice man who listened to Billy attentively, and then asked him to show him how he wrote. Then Billy said that he could draw what he saw instead. He liked to draw a lot, and it seemed like it was the only thing that he was really good at. He drew things exactly how he saw them.The doctor told Billy’s parents that their son had a talent, and they seemed very impressed seeing it themselves. He then said that Billy had dyslexia, a chronic condition that can be improved but never cured, and that he needed to find a way to somehow adapt to his studies. He gave recommendations to extent how long he was able to take on a test and to use more audio materials, but after some time at school Billy understood that he still lagged behind, and everyone was still mocking him because of it. He found it hard to concentrate on his subjects, and his marks slipped even more. So his parents enrolled him in another school that specialized in individualized creative teaching.That’s how he found out that he’s actually pretty smart! He had a tutor who adapted all his subjects to his visual comprehension. He received creative tasks that involved drawing some process or rule instead of describing it in written form, and he was given audiobooks instead of textbooks. And he also took art classes where he became the best straightaway!Billy is still a long way off from finishing school – he’s now in his early teens. But he already knows what he wants to be without a doubt – he wants to be an artist, because it’s the thing that he enjoys most in his life. Thanks to his dyslexia, Billy now never has to study all those things he’s no good at, and doesn’t have to struggle to find out what he really likes, which is drawing. Now he can say that he’s happy to let those letters fly away - he’s better off without them.Music by Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com"

         "Get tickets now: https://www.BohemianRhapsodyTickets.comBohemian Rhapsody is a foot-stomping celebration of Queen, their music and their extraordinary lead singer Freddie Mercury. Freddie defied stereotypes and shattered convention to become one of the most beloved entertainers on the planet. The film traces the meteoric rise of the band through their iconic songs and revolutionary sound. They reach unparalleled success, but in an unexpected turn Freddie, surrounded by darker influences, shuns Queen in pursuit of his solo career. Having suffered greatly without the collaboration of Queen, Freddie manages to reunite with his bandmates just in time for Live Aid. While bravely facing a recent AIDS diagnosis, Freddie leads the band in one of the greatest performances in the history of rock music. Queen cements a legacy that continues to inspire outsiders, dreamers and music lovers to this day.In Theaters November 2, 2018Cast: Rami Malek, Lucy Boynton, Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, Joseph Mazzello, Aidan Gillen, Tom Hollander, Allen Leech and Mike MyersDirected by: Bryan SingerConnect with Bohemian Rhapsody Online:Visit the Bohemian Rhapsody WEBSITE: http://bohemianrhapsody.comLike Bohemian Rhapsody on FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/BohemianRhapsodyMovieFollow Bohemian Rhapsody on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/BoRhapMovieFollow Bohemian Rhapsody on INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/BohemianRhapsodyMovie#BohemianRhapsodyAbout 20th Century FOX:Official YouTube Channel for 20th Century Fox Movies.

         "The good doctor is becoming my favorite show on TV let alone my favorite medical drama. I really have come to appreciate the writing/humor of the show. I think it is so important to be able to not only create a show that is interesting but also keeping it medically accurate and give a great example of how one with autism can strive to new heights. If we can get this video up to 100,000 likes I can use that to try and get Freddie Highmore to do a review with us so smash that like button!!!Anyway, I hope you enjoy this episode of Real Doctor Watches The Good Doctor  / Real Doctor Reacts to The Good Doctor . If you want me to continue making this doctor reaction video please give it a  like and leave me a comment on which tv drama or show you'd like for me to review next. Love you all!

         "Hey Guys! welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!WATCH THE WHOLE SERIES: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...So, this is a special episode because instead of doing my regular 3-4 makeovers, I am doing ONE. BUT the reason is because after my last unboxing video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N03vtRodaQg&t=31s) everyone was begging me to do the giant orange. I knew I wouldn't have time to fit it into a regular video since it's so massive. So I just decided to go all out and take all week working on this one squishy. There is more squishy roasting than any video before. SO MANY REPAIRS. 10 squishies. 8 bottles of paint. Lots of record breaking here LOL I hope you enjoy it!________ Materials List__________http://www.moriah.video/materials.html_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already 2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. Everyone gave me these squishies as donations to the series because they were no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be completely impossible for me financially to send back squishies. Just to RECEIVE these squishies costs me hundreds of dollars (I have to pay for P.O. box fees) There are MANY other reasons as well, I explained it in this video if you want to know the full list of reasons: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKYCV...3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip and Scribbles. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.4. IS PUFFY PAINT THE SAME AS FABRIC PAINT?Yep!! Puffy paint is just a type of fabric paint.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off. 7. WHAT MEMORY FOAM DO YOU USE?I usually just buy a memory foam pillow on Amazon.com and use that to cut up.8. CAN YOU DO MORE SQUISHIES IN EACH VIDEO OR DO MAKEOVER VIDEOS EVERY WEEK?I wish I could! But these videos take me about 30-50 hours to film and edit (not including waiting for the paint to dry or any breaks). And usually about 8 or 9 days of working on it. So it’s not really possible to do these any more than I am already doing without lowering the quality. PLUS! I want to keep up with my Monday videos and my art and craft videos as well ☺9. WHY DO YOU SOMETIMES USE A POPSICLE STICK AND OTHER TIMES USE A PAINTBRUSH TO APPLY PAINT?The “slick” fabric paint has a very thick consistency that does not spread easily with a paint brush. Using a popsicle stick is much easier for this type of paint. BUT the matte fabric paint is much thinner, similar consistency to acrylic paint and it can easily be applied with a paintbrush. When you mix the two, you can get away with a paintbrush as well :)10. WHY DO YOU LIKE RAINBOW SO MUCH?I just like color, and I think rainbows are pretty. There’s really no other reason for my obsession hahaMY CURRENT UPLOAD SCHEDULE:Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Squishy Makeovers (roughly every other Friday), Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kits and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYsANDEvery Other Monday:  Squishy Updates, Create This Book episodes, mail openings/unboxings, announcements, experiments or any other weirdness I come up with...WHERE TO BUY MY BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfIVISIT MY WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/MY MERCH:https://teespring.com/stores/moriah-e...INSTAGRAM: instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficialFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES OR Create This Book photos ONLY:MoriahElizabeth15@gmail.com"

         "IKEA has mastered the “Gruen effect.”Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOResearchers estimate that 50 percent of purchases are unplanned. These purchases, especially impulse buys, present an opportunity for retailers who can entice consumers to deviate from their shopping lists.One of the most effective ways to influence this is through a store’s architecture. In the 20th century, the architect Victor Gruen, who pioneered the first American shopping malls, used light and space to dramatically stage goods in storefront windows. His designs were meant to capture the attention of passersby — and convert them into customers. This conversion became known as the “Gruen effect.”Watch the video above to learn how Ikea has mastered the Gruen effect with a carefully designed store layout that gets customers to travel further distances… and buy more.For the curious, here are a few links:Read Jeffrey Inman’s research on unplanned spending: http://www.advancingretail.org/sites/default/files/resources/The-Effect-of-In-Store-Travel-Distance-on-Unplanned-Spending.pdfWatch a video from University College London Professor Alan Penn, who breaks down Ms. Kazim’s research in greater detail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkePRXxH9D4And finally, I recommend reading Victor Gruen’s biography, “Mallmaker” by Jeffrey Hardwick. You can also learn more by listening to this 99% Invisible podcast episode that features Hardwick and details the history of the Gruen effect: https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-gruen-effect/Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

         "“Aladdin” is the exciting tale of the charming street rat Aladdin, the courageous and self-determined Princess Jasmine and the Genie who may be the key to their future. Directed by Guy Ritchie, who brings his singular flair for fast-paced, visceral action to the fictitious port city of Agrabah, the film is written by John August and Ritchie based on Disney’s “Aladdin.”“Aladdin” stars Will Smith as the larger-than-life Genie; Mena Massoud as the charming scoundrel Aladdin; Naomi Scott as Jasmine, the beautiful, self-determined princess; Marwan Kenzari as Jafar, the powerful sorcerer; Navid Negahban as the Sultan concerned with his daughter’s future; Nasim Pedrad as Dalia, Princess Jasmine’s free-spirited best friend and confidante; Billy Magnussen as the handsome and arrogant suitor Prince Anders; and Numan Acar as Hakim, Jafar’s right-hand man and captain of the palace guards. The film is produced by Dan Lin and Jonathan Eirich with Marc Platt and Kevin De La Noy serving as executive producers. Alan Menken provides the score, which includes new recordings of the original songs written by Menken and lyricists Howard Ashman and Tim Rice and two new songs written by Menken and songwriters Benj Pasek and Justin Paul.The film, which was shot on practical stages in London and on location amidst the stunning desert vistas of Jordan, has a talented creative team helping to bring Agrabah to life, including: director of photography Alan Stewart, production designer Gemma Jackson and costume designer Michael Wilkinson.Facebook:    https://www.facebook.com/DisneyAladdinTwitter:     https://twitter.com/DisneyAladdinInstagram:     https://www.instagram.com/DisneyAladdinYouTube:     https://www.youtube.com/user/DisneyMovieTrailersHashtag:    #Aladdin"

Thankfully, using Wix, it's easy, accessible, and affordable too! Get your own URL, customize your layout, add key features like portfolios or shopping options (there are over 200 features to choose from!), and — of course — get creative! Follow the link to Wix at the top of the description to get started, or if you feel like you want some help, tweet me @mrkatedotcom your profile with the hashtag #CreativeWeirdoSpotlight and for the next What's My Aesthetic video, we might be building your page! During some episodes of this series, Joey and I will be creating a custom website for one of you Creative Weirdos using Wix, and showing it off to the world! This episode, we featured an amazing cupcake baker, and I can't wait to see how her colorful, interactive new website helps her business grow! If you have a business or brand that you want to share with the world, don't stop at just social media pages! Make it official with a Wix website — because there's nothing more in the DIY spirit than creating a professional website yourself! MORE MAKEOVERS!

Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.</td></tr><tr><td>XeAClxSYQc8</td><td>Ellen's Backstage Scares Featuring Kris Jenner, Ciara and Her Staff</td><td>2018-10-31</td><td>UCp0hYYBW6IMayGgR-WeoCvQ</td><td>TheEllenShow</td><td>24</td><td>scare</td><td>408612</td><td>18862</td><td>207</td><td>0</td><td>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XeAClxSYQc8/default.jpg</td><td>One of Ellen's favorite parts of Halloween is scaring her staff.

(好きになっちゃうだろう？)’, 마지막화에서 공개된 단체곡 ‘꿈을 꾸는 동안’ , ‘PRODUCE48’의 메인 테마곡 ‘내꺼야’의 ‘IZ*ONE(아이즈원)’ 버전 등이 새롭게 수록 돼 ‘PRODUCE48’부터 아이즈원을 지켜본 이들이라면 새로운 매력을 느낄 수 있다. 데뷔 미니 앨범 ＜COLOR*IZ＞를  시작으로 아이즈원 멤버들이 전 세계를 향해 보여줄 12가지 색깔의 매력을 지켜 보자.</td></tr><tr><td>D2O7LPnaU7I</td><td>TIME TO SHOOT THE TEAM 10 MOVIE!</td><td>2018-10-28</td><td>UCcgVECVN4OKV6DH1jLkqmcA</td><td>Jake Paul</td><td>22</td><td>jake</td><td>2472525</td><td>75346</td><td>25562</td><td>12833</td><td>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D2O7LPnaU7I/default.jpg</td><td>SUBSCRIBE TO JUSTIN'S CHANNEL!!https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdD2...👕GET MY NEW MERCH HERE BEFORE IT SELLS OUT 👕https://fanjoy.co/collections/jake-paul 🔵SPONSOR MY CHANNEL FOR EXCLUSIVE CONTENT & MORE 🔵https://www.youtube.com/user/JakePaulProductions/sponsorADD ME ON TWITCH ►https://www.twitch.tv/jakepaulgames🔔TURN ON MY POST NOTIFICATIONS FOR SHOUTOUTS IN MY VLOG➡️FOLLOW ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA! ⬅️INSTAGRAM ➤  https://www.instagram.com/JakePaul TWITTER ➤  http://twitter.com/JakePaul FACEBOOK ➤  https://www.facebook.com/JakePaul SNAPCHAT ➤  JakePaul19 MUSICAL.LY ➤  @JakePaul➡️FOLLOW TEAM 10! ⬅️Twitter ➝ http://twitter.com/Team10official Instagram ➝ http://instagram.com/Team10official Facebook ➝ http://instagram.com/Team10official Snapchat ➝ Team10SnapsMusical.ly ➝ @Team10officialWant to text us?  ➝ 1-323-909-4406📗I HAVE A BOOK!! “YOU GOTTA WANT IT 📗 http://amzn.to/2hY5Pyx⚠️ WARNING ⚠️Some effects and visuals may not be suitable for those that suffer from epilepsy.#JakePaul #Team10 #ItsEverydayBro</td></tr><tr><td>8BAmUw45ZkI</td><td>THE TRUTH ABOUT BOYS IN THE BEAUTY COMMUNITY</td><td>2018-10-28</td><td>UCkvK_5omS-42Ovgah8KRKtg</td><td>jeffreestar</td><td>26</td><td>jeffree star</td><td>2991529</td><td>156031</td><td>6658</td><td>20243</td><td>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8BAmUw45ZkI/default.jpg</td><td>HEY EVERYONE...

He’s not blind, nor stupid – nothing like that. He’s dyslexic. This generally means that he’s physically not able to read or write. Or more precisely, he can do it, but he does it 100 times slower than other people. But don’t feel sorry for him! He’s happy this way. Here’s the story of what happened to him.His parents always told him that he needed to do the best he could in his studies in order to excel in life. They’re both very successful – his dad is a lawyer and his mom is a physicist, so his future was well defined from birth. He was supposed to become nothing less than a brain surgeon. And indeed he remembers how he could already do a lot even in his early years – maths, science for kids, things like that. The only thing that worried his parents was that he didn’t manage to learn to read. But he was still very small, so they thought that since he was attending school anyway he would get taught there.When school started, Billy realized straightaway that he was slower than the other kids. It was strange – he had never seemed stupid before; he was generally quick-witted and easily understood anything that was explained to him. But when it came to reading or working with a text of any kind, he seemed to be really slow. For Billy, letters looked like splashes of water that were constantly changing their shape and size. His teachers kept telling him to concentrate, but what was he supposed to do if words were like insects flying off the paper?Billy remembers the first ever test that he got marks for. He understood it was very important to bring a good mark home to his parents, to show them that he wasn’t stupid. He did his best, but unfortunately managed to answer only 3 questions out of 12 in time. He didn’t understand what had happened – the questions were not hard and he knew the answers, but it just took a lot of time to understand what was written and compose his written answer. He broke into a sweat. The last thing he managed to do was write his name, Bill Bumble, on it. As the teacher looked them over she asked him to stand up and read his name from the paper. “Bill Bumble”, he said. She then insisted that he read it from the paper. With great effort, he read what he had actually written. It was “Bill Dumble”. Everyone laughed at him and he felt so embarrassed. “Dumble” became his nickname from that moment on.This made Billy sad, and he ended up being mocked all day and getting a D-. He decided not to suffer on his own, and went to see his parents. They frowned when he told them that he had nearly gotten an F, but when he explained his vanishing letter problem, they decided to take him to see an optician. She checked his eyes and confirmed that his vision was perfect, but suggested a visit to another doctor who specialized in learning problems. He was a very nice man who listened to Billy attentively, and then asked him to show him how he wrote. Then Billy said that he could draw what he saw instead. He liked to draw a lot, and it seemed like it was the only thing that he was really good at. He drew things exactly how he saw them.The doctor told Billy’s parents that their son had a talent, and they seemed very impressed seeing it themselves. He then said that Billy had dyslexia, a chronic condition that can be improved but never cured, and that he needed to find a way to somehow adapt to his studies. He gave recommendations to extent how long he was able to take on a test and to use more audio materials, but after some time at school Billy understood that he still lagged behind, and everyone was still mocking him because of it. He found it hard to concentrate on his subjects, and his marks slipped even more. So his parents enrolled him in another school that specialized in individualized creative teaching.That’s how he found out that he’s actually pretty smart! He had a tutor who adapted all his subjects to his visual comprehension. He received creative tasks that involved drawing some process or rule instead of describing it in written form, and he was given audiobooks instead of textbooks. And he also took art classes where he became the best straightaway!Billy is still a long way off from finishing school – he’s now in his early teens. But he already knows what he wants to be without a doubt – he wants to be an artist, because it’s the thing that he enjoys most in his life. Thanks to his dyslexia, Billy now never has to study all those things he’s no good at, and doesn’t have to struggle to find out what he really likes, which is drawing. Now he can say that he’s happy to let those letters fly away - he’s better off without them.Music by Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com</td></tr><tr><td>SAWzXkV3hHo</td><td>Shawn Mendes, Zedd - Lost In Japan (Original + Remix)</td><td>2018-10-26</td><td>UC4-TgOSMJHn-LtY4zCzbQhw</td><td>ShawnMendesVEVO</td><td>10</td><td>Shawn</td><td>12152765</td><td>963058</td><td>12109</td><td>60391</td><td>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SAWzXkV3hHo/default.jpg</td><td>Lost In Japan: https://IslandRecs.lnk.to/LostInJapan Lost In Japan (Remix): https://islandrecs.lnk.to/LostInJapanRemixStream/buy Shawn Mendes: The Album now: https://IslandRecs.lnk.to/ShawnMendesFollow Shawn Mendes:Twitter: https://twitter.com/shawnmendesInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/shawnmendesFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ShawnMendesOfficialWebsite: https://www.shawnmendesofficial.comFollow Zedd:Subscribe to YouTube channel: http://zedd.me/YTSubscribeWebsite: https://www.zedd.netFacebook: http://zedd.me/FacebookInstagram: http://zedd.me/InstagramSpotify: http://zedd.me/SPEssentialsTwitter: http://zedd.me/TwitterVK: http://zedd.me/VKcomSnapchat: http://zedd.me/SnapchatShop the Zedd Official Store: http://zedd.me/StoreListen to Zedd Radio: http://zedd.me/SPRadioSee Zedd live: http://zedd.me/LiveLyrics:All it'd take is one flightWe be in the same time zoneLooking through your timelineSeeing all the rainbows, II got an ideaAnd I know that it sounds crazyI just wanna see yaAll I gotta ask,Do you got plans tonight?I’m a couple hundred miles from Japan and IAnd I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight‘Cause I can’t get you off my mindCan’t get you off my mindCan’t get you off my mind (uhh)I can feel the tensionWe could cut it with a knifeI know it’s more than just a friendshipI can hear you think I’m right, yeahDo I gotta convince you that you shouldn’t fall asleep?It’ll only be a couple hours,And I’m about to leaveDo you got plans tonight?I’m a couple hundred miles from Japan and IAnd I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight‘Cause I can’t get you off my mindCan’t get you off my mindCan’t get you off my mindDo you got plans tonight?I was hoping I could get lost in your paradiseThe only thing I’m thinking ‘bout is you and i‘Cause I can’t get you off my mindCan’t get you off my mindI can’t seem to get you off my mindLet’s get lost tonight (uhh)Let’s get lost tonightBaby you and…I can’t seem to get you off my mindLet’s get lost tonightLet’s get lost tonightBaby you and…I can’t seem to get you off my mindDo you got plans tonight?I’m a couple hundred miles from Japan and IAnd I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight‘Cause I can’t get you off my mindI can’t get you off my mindDo you got plans tonight, babyI was hoping I could get lost in your paradiseThe only thing I’m thinking ‘bout is you and IAnd I can’t get you off my mindCan’t get you off my mindI can’t seem to get you off my mindLet’s get lost tonightLet’s get lost tonightBaby you and…I can’t seem to get you off my mindLet’s get lost tonightLet’s get lost tonightBaby you and…I can’t seem to get you off my mindMusic video by Shawn Mendes, Zedd performing Lost In Japan (Original + Remix). © 2018 Island Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.http://vevo.ly/txtHgL</td></tr><tr><td>6F1iqcxvfBc</td><td>NBA Youngboy - Temporary Time</td><td>2018-10-26</td><td>UClW4jraMKz6Qj69lJf-tODA</td><td>YoungBoy Never Broke Again</td><td>1</td><td>[none]</td><td>3340201</td><td>128494</td><td>3020</td><td>10643</td><td>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6F1iqcxvfBc/default.jpg</td><td>NEW YB@Tobiali</td></tr><tr><td>MYNl2Y5AV3g</td><td>Mermaid Halloween Makeup Tutorial</td><td>2018-10-26</td><td>UCucot-Zp428OwkyRm2I7v2Q</td><td>James Charles</td><td>24</td><td>james</td><td>3499561</td><td>187090</td><td>3386</td><td>14492</td><td>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MYNl2Y5AV3g/default.jpg</td><td>HI SISTERS!

What began as an unlikely friendship between an adolescent Viking and a fearsome Night Fury dragon has become an epic adventure spanning their lives.  Welcome to the most astonishing chapter of one of the most beloved animated franchises in film history: How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World.  Now chief and ruler of Berk alongside Astrid, Hiccup has created a gloriously chaotic dragon utopia.  When the sudden appearance of female Light Fury coincides with the darkest threat their village has ever faced, Hiccup and Toothless must leave the only home they’ve known and journey to a hidden world thought only to exist in myth.  As their true destines are revealed, dragon and rider will fight together—to the very ends of the Earth—to protect everything they’ve grown to treasure.For How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, series director Dean DeBlois returns alongside the all-star cast.  The film is produced by Brad Lewis (Ratatouille, ANTZ) and Bonnie Arnold (Toy Story, How to Train Your Dragon,How to Train Your Dragon 2).Follow DreamWorksTV! instagram - https://instagram.com/dreamworkstv/twitter - https://twitter.com/dreamworkstvfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/dreamworkstvJoin the fun on DreamWorksTV where you can find an endless supply of laugh-out-loud jokes, lovable characters, life hacks, music, magic, gaming and more!

Freddie defied stereotypes and shattered convention to become one of the most beloved entertainers on the planet. The film traces the meteoric rise of the band through their iconic songs and revolutionary sound. They reach unparalleled success, but in an unexpected turn Freddie, surrounded by darker influences, shuns Queen in pursuit of his solo career. Having suffered greatly without the collaboration of Queen, Freddie manages to reunite with his bandmates just in time for Live Aid. While bravely facing a recent AIDS diagnosis, Freddie leads the band in one of the greatest performances in the history of rock music. Queen cements a legacy that continues to inspire outsiders, dreamers and music lovers to this day.In Theaters November 2, 2018Cast: Rami Malek, Lucy Boynton, Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, Joseph Mazzello, Aidan Gillen, Tom Hollander, Allen Leech and Mike MyersDirected by: Bryan SingerConnect with Bohemian Rhapsody Online:Visit the Bohemian Rhapsody WEBSITE: http://bohemianrhapsody.comLike Bohemian Rhapsody on FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/BohemianRhapsodyMovieFollow Bohemian Rhapsody on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/BoRhapMovieFollow Bohemian Rhapsody on INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/BohemianRhapsodyMovie#BohemianRhapsodyAbout 20th Century FOX:Official YouTube Channel for 20th Century Fox Movies.

I really have come to appreciate the writing/humor of the show. I think it is so important to be able to not only create a show that is interesting but also keeping it medically accurate and give a great example of how one with autism can strive to new heights. If we can get this video up to 100,000 likes I can use that to try and get Freddie Highmore to do a review with us so smash that like button!!!Anyway, I hope you enjoy this episode of Real Doctor Watches The Good Doctor  / Real Doctor Reacts to The Good Doctor .

I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!WATCH THE WHOLE SERIES: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...So, this is a special episode because instead of doing my regular 3-4 makeovers, I am doing ONE. BUT the reason is because after my last unboxing video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N03vtRodaQg&t=31s) everyone was begging me to do the giant orange. I knew I wouldn't have time to fit it into a regular video since it's so massive. So I just decided to go all out and take all week working on this one squishy. There is more squishy roasting than any video before. SO MANY REPAIRS. 10 squishies. 8 bottles of paint. Lots of record breaking here LOL I hope you enjoy it!________ Materials List__________http://www.moriah.video/materials.html_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already 2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. Everyone gave me these squishies as donations to the series because they were no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be completely impossible for me financially to send back squishies. Just to RECEIVE these squishies costs me hundreds of dollars (I have to pay for P.O. box fees) There are MANY other reasons as well, I explained it in this video if you want to know the full list of reasons: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKYCV...3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip and Scribbles. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.4. IS PUFFY PAINT THE SAME AS FABRIC PAINT?Yep!! Puffy paint is just a type of fabric paint.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off. 7. WHAT MEMORY FOAM DO YOU USE?I usually just buy a memory foam pillow on Amazon.com and use that to cut up.8. CAN YOU DO MORE SQUISHIES IN EACH VIDEO OR DO MAKEOVER VIDEOS EVERY WEEK?I wish I could! But these videos take me about 30-50 hours to film and edit (not including waiting for the paint to dry or any breaks). And usually about 8 or 9 days of working on it. So it’s not really possible to do these any more than I am already doing without lowering the quality. PLUS! I want to keep up with my Monday videos and my art and craft videos as well ☺9. WHY DO YOU SOMETIMES USE A POPSICLE STICK AND OTHER TIMES USE A PAINTBRUSH TO APPLY PAINT?The “slick” fabric paint has a very thick consistency that does not spread easily with a paint brush. Using a popsicle stick is much easier for this type of paint. BUT the matte fabric paint is much thinner, similar consistency to acrylic paint and it can easily be applied with a paintbrush. When you mix the two, you can get away with a paintbrush as well :)10. WHY DO YOU LIKE RAINBOW SO MUCH?I just like color, and I think rainbows are pretty. There’s really no other reason for my obsession hahaMY CURRENT UPLOAD SCHEDULE:Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Squishy Makeovers (roughly every other Friday), Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kits and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYsANDEvery Other Monday:  Squishy Updates, Create This Book episodes, mail openings/unboxings, announcements, experiments or any other weirdness I come up with...WHERE TO BUY MY BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfIVISIT MY WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/MY MERCH:https://teespring.com/stores/moriah-e...INSTAGRAM: instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficialFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES OR Create This Book photos ONLY:MoriahElizabeth15@gmail.com</td></tr><tr><td>p1mJP5TVCjE</td><td>The Try Guys Answer the Web's Most Searched Questions | WIRED</td><td>2018-10-19</td><td>UCftwRNsjfRo08xYE31tkiyw</td><td>WIRED</td><td>24</td><td>autocomplete interview</td><td>3695293</td><td>160197</td><td>2823</td><td>6821</td><td>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p1mJP5TVCjE/default.jpg</td><td>Keith, Ned, Zach, and Eugene of The Try Guys take the WIRED Autocomplete Interview and answer the internet's most searched questions about The Try Guys and themselves.

These purchases, especially impulse buys, present an opportunity for retailers who can entice consumers to deviate from their shopping lists.One of the most effective ways to influence this is through a store’s architecture. In the 20th century, the architect Victor Gruen, who pioneered the first American shopping malls, used light and space to dramatically stage goods in storefront windows. His designs were meant to capture the attention of passersby — and convert them into customers. This conversion became known as the “Gruen effect.”Watch the video above to learn how Ikea has mastered the Gruen effect with a carefully designed store layout that gets customers to travel further distances… and buy more.For the curious, here are a few links:Read Jeffrey Inman’s research on unplanned spending: http://www.advancingretail.org/sites/default/files/resources/The-Effect-of-In-Store-Travel-Distance-on-Unplanned-Spending.pdfWatch a video from University College London Professor Alan Penn, who breaks down Ms. Kazim’s research in greater detail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkePRXxH9D4And finally, I recommend reading Victor Gruen’s biography, “Mallmaker” by Jeffrey Hardwick. You can also learn more by listening to this 99% Invisible podcast episode that features Hardwick and details the history of the Gruen effect: https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-gruen-effect/Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Thankfully, using Wix, it's easy, accessible, and affordable too! Get your own URL, customize your layout, add key features like portfolios or shopping options (there are over 200 features to choose from!), and — of course — get creative! Follow the link to Wix at the top of the description to get started, or if you feel like you want some help, tweet me @mrkatedotcom your profile with the hashtag #CreativeWeirdoSpotlight and for the next What's My Aesthetic video, we might be building your page! During some episodes of this series, Joey and I will be creating a custom website for one of you Creative Weirdos using Wix, and showing it off to the world! This episode, we featured an amazing cupcake baker, and I can't wait to see how her colorful, interactive new website helps her business grow! If you have a business or brand that you want to share with the world, don't stop at just social media pages! Make it official with a Wix website — because there's nothing more in the DIY spirit than creating a professional website yourself! MORE MAKEOVERS!

(好きになっちゃうだろう？)’, 마지막화에서 공개된 단체곡 ‘꿈을 꾸는 동안’ , ‘PRODUCE48’의 메인 테마곡 ‘내꺼야’의 ‘IZ*ONE(아이즈원)’ 버전 등이 새롭게 수록 돼 ‘PRODUCE48’부터 아이즈원을 지켜본 이들이라면 새로운 매력을 느낄 수 있다. 데뷔 미니 앨범 ＜COLOR*IZ＞를  시작으로 아이즈원 멤버들이 전 세계를 향해 보여줄 12가지 색깔의 매력을 지켜 보자."

         "SUBSCRIBE If you like my channel: ► https://bit.ly/2J5HP7jThis is Billy, and he can’t read. He’s not blind, nor stupid – nothing like that. He’s dyslexic. This generally means that he’s physically not able to read or write. Or more precisely, he can do it, but he does it 100 times slower than other people. But don’t feel sorry for him! He’s happy this way. Here’s the story of what happened to him.His parents always told him that he needed to do the best he could in his studies in order to excel in life. They’re both very successful – his dad is a lawyer and his mom is a physicist, so his future was well defined from birth. He was supposed to become nothing less than a brain surgeon. And indeed he remembers how he could already do a lot even in his early years – maths, science for kids, things like that. The only thing that worried his parents was that he didn’t manage to learn to read. But he was still very small, so they thought that since he was attending school anyway he would get taught there.When school started, Billy realized straightaway that he was slower than the other kids. It was strange – he had never seemed stupid before; he was generally quick-witted and easily understood anything that was explained to him. But when it came to reading or working with a text of any kind, he seemed to be really slow. For Billy, letters looked like splashes of water that were constantly changing their shape and size. His teachers kept telling him to concentrate, but what was he supposed to do if words were like insects flying off the paper?Billy remembers the first ever test that he got marks for. He understood it was very important to bring a good mark home to his parents, to show them that he wasn’t stupid. He did his best, but unfortunately managed to answer only 3 questions out of 12 in time. He didn’t understand what had happened – the questions were not hard and he knew the answers, but it just took a lot of time to understand what was written and compose his written answer. He broke into a sweat. The last thing he managed to do was write his name, Bill Bumble, on it. As the teacher looked them over she asked him to stand up and read his name from the paper. “Bill Bumble”, he said. She then insisted that he read it from the paper. With great effort, he read what he had actually written. It was “Bill Dumble”. Everyone laughed at him and he felt so embarrassed. “Dumble” became his nickname from that moment on.This made Billy sad, and he ended up being mocked all day and getting a D-. He decided not to suffer on his own, and went to see his parents. They frowned when he told them that he had nearly gotten an F, but when he explained his vanishing letter problem, they decided to take him to see an optician. She checked his eyes and confirmed that his vision was perfect, but suggested a visit to another doctor who specialized in learning problems. He was a very nice man who listened to Billy attentively, and then asked him to show him how he wrote. Then Billy said that he could draw what he saw instead. He liked to draw a lot, and it seemed like it was the only thing that he was really good at. He drew things exactly how he saw them.The doctor told Billy’s parents that their son had a talent, and they seemed very impressed seeing it themselves. He then said that Billy had dyslexia, a chronic condition that can be improved but never cured, and that he needed to find a way to somehow adapt to his studies. He gave recommendations to extent how long he was able to take on a test and to use more audio materials, but after some time at school Billy understood that he still lagged behind, and everyone was still mocking him because of it. He found it hard to concentrate on his subjects, and his marks slipped even more. So his parents enrolled him in another school that specialized in individualized creative teaching.That’s how he found out that he’s actually pretty smart! He had a tutor who adapted all his subjects to his visual comprehension. He received creative tasks that involved drawing some process or rule instead of describing it in written form, and he was given audiobooks instead of textbooks. And he also took art classes where he became the best straightaway!Billy is still a long way off from finishing school – he’s now in his early teens. But he already knows what he wants to be without a doubt – he wants to be an artist, because it’s the thing that he enjoys most in his life. Thanks to his dyslexia, Billy now never has to study all those things he’s no good at, and doesn’t have to struggle to find out what he really likes, which is drawing. Now he can say that he’s happy to let those letters fly away - he’s better off without them.Music by Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com"

         "Get tickets now: https://www.BohemianRhapsodyTickets.comBohemian Rhapsody is a foot-stomping celebration of Queen, their music and their extraordinary lead singer Freddie Mercury. Freddie defied stereotypes and shattered convention to become one of the most beloved entertainers on the planet. The film traces the meteoric rise of the band through their iconic songs and revolutionary sound. They reach unparalleled success, but in an unexpected turn Freddie, surrounded by darker influences, shuns Queen in pursuit of his solo career. Having suffered greatly without the collaboration of Queen, Freddie manages to reunite with his bandmates just in time for Live Aid. While bravely facing a recent AIDS diagnosis, Freddie leads the band in one of the greatest performances in the history of rock music. Queen cements a legacy that continues to inspire outsiders, dreamers and music lovers to this day.In Theaters November 2, 2018Cast: Rami Malek, Lucy Boynton, Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, Joseph Mazzello, Aidan Gillen, Tom Hollander, Allen Leech and Mike MyersDirected by: Bryan SingerConnect with Bohemian Rhapsody Online:Visit the Bohemian Rhapsody WEBSITE: http://bohemianrhapsody.comLike Bohemian Rhapsody on FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/BohemianRhapsodyMovieFollow Bohemian Rhapsody on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/BoRhapMovieFollow Bohemian Rhapsody on INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/BohemianRhapsodyMovie#BohemianRhapsodyAbout 20th Century FOX:Official YouTube Channel for 20th Century Fox Movies.

I think it is so important to be able to not only create a show that is interesting but also keeping it medically accurate and give a great example of how one with autism can strive to new heights. If we can get this video up to 100,000 likes I can use that to try and get Freddie Highmore to do a review with us so smash that like button!!!Anyway, I hope you enjoy this episode of Real Doctor Watches The Good Doctor  / Real Doctor Reacts to The Good Doctor .

         "Hey Guys! welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!WATCH THE WHOLE SERIES: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...So, this is a special episode because instead of doing my regular 3-4 makeovers, I am doing ONE. BUT the reason is because after my last unboxing video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N03vtRodaQg&t=31s) everyone was begging me to do the giant orange. I knew I wouldn't have time to fit it into a regular video since it's so massive. So I just decided to go all out and take all week working on this one squishy. There is more squishy roasting than any video before. SO MANY REPAIRS. 10 squishies. 8 bottles of paint. Lots of record breaking here LOL I hope you enjoy it!________ Materials List__________http://www.moriah.video/materials.html_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already 2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. Everyone gave me these squishies as donations to the series because they were no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be completely impossible for me financially to send back squishies. Just to RECEIVE these squishies costs me hundreds of dollars (I have to pay for P.O. box fees) There are MANY other reasons as well, I explained it in this video if you want to know the full list of reasons: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKYCV...3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip and Scribbles. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.4. IS PUFFY PAINT THE SAME AS FABRIC PAINT?Yep!! Puffy paint is just a type of fabric paint.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off. 7. WHAT MEMORY FOAM DO YOU USE?I usually just buy a memory foam pillow on Amazon.com and use that to cut up.8. CAN YOU DO MORE SQUISHIES IN EACH VIDEO OR DO MAKEOVER VIDEOS EVERY WEEK?I wish I could! But these videos take me about 30-50 hours to film and edit (not including waiting for the paint to dry or any breaks). And usually about 8 or 9 days of working on it. So it’s not really possible to do these any more than I am already doing without lowering the quality. PLUS! I want to keep up with my Monday videos and my art and craft videos as well ☺9. WHY DO YOU SOMETIMES USE A POPSICLE STICK AND OTHER TIMES USE A PAINTBRUSH TO APPLY PAINT?The “slick” fabric paint has a very thick consistency that does not spread easily with a paint brush. Using a popsicle stick is much easier for this type of paint. BUT the matte fabric paint is much thinner, similar consistency to acrylic paint and it can easily be applied with a paintbrush. When you mix the two, you can get away with a paintbrush as well :)10. WHY DO YOU LIKE RAINBOW SO MUCH?I just like color, and I think rainbows are pretty. There’s really no other reason for my obsession hahaMY CURRENT UPLOAD SCHEDULE:Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Squishy Makeovers (roughly every other Friday), Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kits and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYsANDEvery Other Monday:  Squishy Updates, Create This Book episodes, mail openings/unboxings, announcements, experiments or any other weirdness I come up with...WHERE TO BUY MY BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfIVISIT MY WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/MY MERCH:https://teespring.com/stores/moriah-e...INSTAGRAM: instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficialFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES OR Create This Book photos ONLY:MoriahElizabeth15@gmail.com"

         "IKEA has mastered the “Gruen effect.”Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOResearchers estimate that 50 percent of purchases are unplanned. These purchases, especially impulse buys, present an opportunity for retailers who can entice consumers to deviate from their shopping lists.One of the most effective ways to influence this is through a store’s architecture. In the 20th century, the architect Victor Gruen, who pioneered the first American shopping malls, used light and space to dramatically stage goods in storefront windows. His designs were meant to capture the attention of passersby — and convert them into customers. This conversion became known as the “Gruen effect.”Watch the video above to learn how Ikea has mastered the Gruen effect with a carefully designed store layout that gets customers to travel further distances… and buy more.For the curious, here are a few links:Read Jeffrey Inman’s research on unplanned spending: http://www.advancingretail.org/sites/default/files/resources/The-Effect-of-In-Store-Travel-Distance-on-Unplanned-Spending.pdfWatch a video from University College London Professor Alan Penn, who breaks down Ms. Kazim’s research in greater detail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkePRXxH9D4And finally, I recommend reading Victor Gruen’s biography, “Mallmaker” by Jeffrey Hardwick. You can also learn more by listening to this 99% Invisible podcast episode that features Hardwick and details the history of the Gruen effect: https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-gruen-effect/Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

         "“Aladdin” is the exciting tale of the charming street rat Aladdin, the courageous and self-determined Princess Jasmine and the Genie who may be the key to their future. Directed by Guy Ritchie, who brings his singular flair for fast-paced, visceral action to the fictitious port city of Agrabah, the film is written by John August and Ritchie based on Disney’s “Aladdin.”“Aladdin” stars Will Smith as the larger-than-life Genie; Mena Massoud as the charming scoundrel Aladdin; Naomi Scott as Jasmine, the beautiful, self-determined princess; Marwan Kenzari as Jafar, the powerful sorcerer; Navid Negahban as the Sultan concerned with his daughter’s future; Nasim Pedrad as Dalia, Princess Jasmine’s free-spirited best friend and confidante; Billy Magnussen as the handsome and arrogant suitor Prince Anders; and Numan Acar as Hakim, Jafar’s right-hand man and captain of the palace guards. The film is produced by Dan Lin and Jonathan Eirich with Marc Platt and Kevin De La Noy serving as executive producers. Alan Menken provides the score, which includes new recordings of the original songs written by Menken and lyricists Howard Ashman and Tim Rice and two new songs written by Menken and songwriters Benj Pasek and Justin Paul.The film, which was shot on practical stages in London and on location amidst the stunning desert vistas of Jordan, has a talented creative team helping to bring Agrabah to life, including: director of photography Alan Stewart, production designer Gemma Jackson and costume designer Michael Wilkinson.Facebook:    https://www.facebook.com/DisneyAladdinTwitter:     https://twitter.com/DisneyAladdinInstagram:     https://www.instagram.com/DisneyAladdinYouTube:     https://www.youtube.com/user/DisneyMovieTrailersHashtag:    #Aladdin"

Thankfully, using Wix, it's easy, accessible, and affordable too! Get your own URL, customize your layout, add key features like portfolios or shopping options (there are over 200 features to choose from!), and — of course — get creative! Follow the link to Wix at the top of the description to get started, or if you feel like you want some help, tweet me @mrkatedotcom your profile with the hashtag #CreativeWeirdoSpotlight and for the next What's My Aesthetic video, we might be building your page! During some episodes of this series, Joey and I will be creating a custom website for one of you Creative Weirdos using Wix, and showing it off to the world! This episode, we featured an amazing cupcake baker, and I can't wait to see how her colorful, interactive new website helps her business grow! If you have a business or brand that you want to share with the world, don't stop at just social media pages! Make it official with a Wix website — because there's nothing more in the DIY spirit than creating a professional website yourself! MORE MAKEOVERS!

httpsbitlyjhpjthis is billy and he cant read hes not blind nor stupid nothing like that hes dyslexic this generally means that hes physically not able to read or write or more precisely he can do it but he does it times slower than other people but dont feel sorry for him hes happy this way heres the story of what happened to himhis parents always told him that he needed to do the best he could in his studies in order to excel in life theyre both very successful his dad is a lawyer and his mom is a physicist so his future was well defined from birth he was supposed to become nothing less than a brain surgeon and indeed he remembers how he could already do a lot even in his early years maths science for kids things like that the only thing that worried his parents was that he didnt manage to learn to read but he was still very small so they thought that since he was attending school anyway he would get taught therewhen school started billy realized straightaway that he was slower than the other kids it was strange he had never seemed stupid before he was generally quickwitted and easily understood anything that was explained to him but when it came to reading or working with a text of any kind he seemed to be really slow for billy letters looked like splashes of water that were constantly changing their shape and size his teachers kept telling him to concentrate but what was he supposed to do if words were like insects flying off the paperbilly remembers the first ever test that he got marks for he understood it was very important to bring a good mark home to his parents to show them that he wasnt stupid he did his best but unfortunately managed to answer only questions out of in time he didnt understand what had happened the questions were not hard and he knew the answers but it just took a lot of time to understand what was written and compose his written answer he broke into a sweat the last thing he managed to do was write his name bill bumble on it as the teacher looked them over she asked him to stand up and read his name from the paper bill bumble he said she then insisted that he read it from the paper with great effort he read what he had actually written it was bill dumble everyone laughed at him and he felt so embarrassed dumble became his nickname from that moment onthis made billy sad and he ended up being mocked all day and getting a d he decided not to suffer on his own and went to see his parents they frowned when he told them that he had nearly gotten an f but when he explained his vanishing letter problem they decided to take him to see an optician she checked his eyes and confirmed that his vision was perfect but suggested a visit to another doctor who specialized in learning problems he was a very nice man who listened to billy attentively and then asked him to show him how he wrote then billy said that he could draw what he saw instead he liked to draw a lot and it seemed like it was the only thing that he was really good at he drew things exactly how he saw themthe doctor told billys parents that their son had a talent and they seemed very impressed seeing it themselves he then said that billy had dyslexia a chronic condition that can be improved but never cured and that he needed to find a way to somehow adapt to his studies he gave recommendations to extent how long he was able to take on a test and to use more audio materials but after some time at school billy understood that he still lagged behind and everyone was still mocking him because of it he found it hard to concentrate on his subjects and his marks slipped even more so his parents enrolled him in another school that specialized in individualized creative teachingthats how he found out that hes actually pretty smart he had a tutor who adapted all his subjects to his visual comprehension he received creative tasks that involved drawing some process or rule instead of describing it in written form and he was given audiobooks instead of textbooks and he also took art classes where he became the best straightawaybilly is still a long way off from finishing school hes now in his early teens but he already knows what he wants to be without a doubt he wants to be an artist because its the thing that he enjoys most in his life thanks to his dyslexia billy now never has to study all those things hes no good at and doesnt have to struggle to find out what he really likes which is drawing now he can say that hes happy to let those letters fly away hes better off without themmusic by epidemic sound

episode of squishy makeovers where i transform ugly used old dirty cheap or unwanted squishies donated by my subscribers into my own creations i repair paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these hopefully you like them get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles because i am addicted to bothwatch the whole series httpswwwyoutubecomplaylistlistso this is a special episode because instead of doing my regular makeovers i am doing one but the reason is because after my last unboxing video httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnvtrodaqgts everyone was begging me to do the giant orange i knew i wouldnt have time to fit it into a regular video since its so massive so i just decided to go all out and take all week working on this one squishy there is more squishy roasting than any video before so many repairs squishies bottles of paint lots of record breaking here lol i hope you enjoy it________ materials list__________httpwwwmoriahvideomaterialshtml_________faqs__________ can i send you squishiesso many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so i actually have a lot to work on already are squishies returned to the senders after the makeoverno everyone gave me these squishies as donations to the series because they were no longer wanted everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned it would be completely impossible for me financially to send back squishies just to receive these squishies costs me hundreds of dollars i have to pay for po box fees there are many other reasons as well i explained it in this video if you want to know the full list of reasons httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgkycv what paint do you usei use fabric paint fabric paint is meant to stretch so it is perfect for squishing any brand will work fine but i mainly use tulip and scribbles you can find it at michaels hobby lobby ac moore walmart joann fabrics and online is puffy paint the same as fabric paintyep puffy paint is just a type of fabric paint will fabric paint crackthe matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing slick fabric paints never crack but there are benefits to both i usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds can i use acrylic paint on squishiesi would not recommend that acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard or it will crack and flake off what memory foam do you usei usually just buy a memory foam pillow on amazoncom and use that to cut up can you do more squishies in each video or do makeover videos every weeki wish i could but these videos take me about hours to film and edit not including waiting for the paint to dry or any breaks and usually about or days of working on it so its not really possible to do these any more than i am already doing without lowering the quality plus i want to keep up with my monday videos and my art and craft videos as well why do you sometimes use a popsicle stick and other times use a paintbrush to apply paintthe slick fabric paint has a very thick consistency that does not spread easily with a paint brush using a popsicle stick is much easier for this type of paint but the matte fabric paint is much thinner similar consistency to acrylic paint and it can easily be applied with a paintbrush when you mix the two you can get away with a paintbrush as well why do you like rainbow so muchi just like color and i think rainbows are pretty theres really no other reason for my obsession hahamy current upload scheduleevery friday at pm et squishy makeovers roughly every other friday thrift makeovers craft kits and miscellaneous

httpsbitlyjhpjthis is billy and he cant read hes not blind nor stupid nothing like that hes dyslexic this generally means that hes physically not able to read or write or more precisely he can do it but he does it times slower than other people but dont feel sorry for him hes happy this way heres the story of what happened to himhis parents always told him that he needed to do the best he could in his studies in order to excel in life theyre both very successful his dad is a lawyer and his mom is a physicist so his future was well defined from birth he was supposed to become nothing less than a brain surgeon and indeed he remembers how he could already do a lot even in his early years maths science for kids things like that the only thing that worried his parents was that he didnt manage to learn to read but he was still very small so they thought that since he was attending school anyway he would get taught therewhen school started billy realized straightaway that he was slower than the other kids it was strange he had never seemed stupid before he was generally quickwitted and easily understood anything that was explained to him but when it came to reading or working with a text of any kind he seemed to be really slow for billy letters looked like splashes of water that were constantly changing their shape and size his teachers kept telling him to concentrate but what was he supposed to do if words were like insects flying off the paperbilly remembers the first ever test that he got marks for he understood it was very important to bring a good mark home to his parents to show them that he wasnt stupid he did his best but unfortunately managed to answer only questions out of in time he didnt understand what had happened the questions were not hard and he knew the answers but it just took a lot of time to understand what was written and compose his written answer he broke into a sweat the last thing he managed to do was write his name bill bumble on it as the teacher looked them over she asked him to stand up and read his name from the paper bill bumble he said she then insisted that he read it from the paper with great effort he read what he had actually written it was bill dumble everyone laughed at him and he felt so embarrassed dumble became his nickname from that moment onthis made billy sad and he ended up being mocked all day and getting a d he decided not to suffer on his own and went to see his parents they frowned when he told them that he had nearly gotten an f but when he explained his vanishing letter problem they decided to take him to see an optician she checked his eyes and confirmed that his vision was perfect but suggested a visit to another doctor who specialized in learning problems he was a very nice man who listened to billy attentively and then asked him to show him how he wrote then billy said that he could draw what he saw instead he liked to draw a lot and it seemed like it was the only thing that he was really good at he drew things exactly how he saw themthe doctor told billys parents that their son had a talent and they seemed very impressed seeing it themselves he then said that billy had dyslexia a chronic condition that can be improved but never cured and that he needed to find a way to somehow adapt to his studies he gave recommendations to extent how long he was able to take on a test and to use more audio materials but after some time at school billy understood that he still lagged behind and everyone was still mocking him because of it he found it hard to concentrate on his subjects and his marks slipped even more so his parents enrolled him in another school that specialized in individualized creative teachingthats how he found out that hes actually pretty smart he had a tutor who adapted all his subjects to his visual comprehension he received creative tasks that involved drawing some process or rule instead of describing it in written form and he was given audiobooks instead of textbooks and he also took art classes where he became the best straightawaybilly is still a long way off from finishing school hes now in his early teens but he already knows what he wants to be without a doubt he wants to be an artist because its the thing that he enjoys most in his life thanks to his dyslexia billy now never has to study all those things hes no good at and doesnt have to struggle to find out what he really likes which is drawing now he can say that hes happy to let those letters fly away hes better off without themmusic by epidemic sound

transform ugly used old dirty cheap or unwanted squishies donated by my subscribers into my own creations i repair paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these hopefully you like them get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles because i am addicted to bothwatch the whole series httpswwwyoutubecomplaylistlistso this is a special episode because instead of doing my regular makeovers i am doing one but the reason is because after my last unboxing video httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnvtrodaqgts everyone was begging me to do the giant orange i knew i wouldnt have time to fit it into a regular video since its so massive so i just decided to go all out and take all week working on this one squishy there is more squishy roasting than any video before so many repairs squishies bottles of paint lots of record breaking here lol i hope you enjoy it________ materials list__________httpwwwmoriahvideomaterialshtml_________faqs__________ can i send you squishiesso many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so i actually have a lot to work on already are squishies returned to the senders after the makeoverno everyone gave me these squishies as donations to the series because they were no longer wanted everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned it would be completely impossible for me financially to send back squishies just to receive these squishies costs me hundreds of dollars i have to pay for po box fees there are many other reasons as well i explained it in this video if you want to know the full list of reasons httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgkycv what paint do you usei use fabric paint fabric paint is meant to stretch so it is perfect for squishing any brand will work fine but i mainly use tulip and scribbles you can find it at michaels hobby lobby ac moore walmart joann fabrics and online is puffy paint the same as fabric paintyep puffy paint is just a type of fabric paint will fabric paint crackthe matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing slick fabric paints never crack but there are benefits to both i usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds can i use acrylic paint on squishiesi would not recommend that acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard or it will crack and flake off what memory foam do you usei usually just buy a memory foam pillow on amazoncom and use that to cut up can you do more squishies in each video or do makeover videos every weeki wish i could but these videos take me about hours to film and edit not including waiting for the paint to dry or any breaks and usually about or days of working on it so its not really possible to do these any more than i am already doing without lowering the quality plus i want to keep up with my monday videos and my art and craft videos as well why do you sometimes use a popsicle stick and other times use a paintbrush to apply paintthe slick fabric paint has a very thick consistency that does not spread easily with a paint brush using a popsicle stick is much easier for this type of paint but the matte fabric paint is much thinner similar consistency to acrylic paint and it can easily be applied with a paintbrush when you mix the two you can get away with a paintbrush as well why do you like rainbow so muchi just like color and i think rainbows are pretty theres really no other reason for my obsession hahamy current upload scheduleevery friday at pm et squishy makeovers roughly every other friday thrift makeovers craft kits and miscellaneous crafts and
